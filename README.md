# **Todo List App**

A dynamic and interactive Todo List application built with React and Vite. The app enables users to efficiently manage their tasks by adding, ticking/unticking, and removing todos. Task counts are updated in real time, and the application leverages local storage to maintain state between sessions.

- **Task Count:** Displays the total number of tasks added.
